C++ Overview-:
	
	The C++ is following :
		1.A statically typed, 
		2.Compiled, 
		3.General-purpose
	       	4.Case-sensitive
	       	5.Free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.
	       	6.The C++ is middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.
		Note:− A programming language is said to use static typing when type checking is performed during compile-time as opposed to run-time.		
OOP Features-:
	C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of object-oriented development:
       		1. Encapsulation
		2. Data hiding
		3. Inheritance
		4. Polymorphism
Standard Libraries-:
	Standard C++ libraries consists of three important parts :
		1.The Core language giving all the "building blocks including variables, data types and literals", etc.
		2.The "C++ Standard Library" giving a rich set of functions manipulating files, strings, etc.
		3.The "Standard Template Library (STL)" giving a rich set of methods manipulating data structures, etc.
C++ Basic Syntax:
		When we consider a C++ program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each other's methods. Let us now
	       	briefly look into what a class, object, methods, and instant variables mean.

		Q.1 Object −:
	       	In C++, Object is a real world entity, for example, chair, car, pen, mobile, laptop etc.Object is a runtime entity, it is created at runtime.Object is an
	       	instance of a class. All the members of the class can be accessed through object. Objects have "states and behaviors". Example: If we consider dog is an
	       	object then it has-: 
			1.States - Color, Name, Breed .
		        2.Behaviors - Wagging, Barking, Eating .	
		An object is an instance of a class.Sometimes we can refer object are variable that store data type that tell compiler which kind of data we 
		are going to store in this variable in a particular memory location.
		Q.2 Class-:
		A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support.The class is derieved data
		data type.

		Q.3 Methods −:
	       	A method is basically a behavior.A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all
	       	the actions are executed.

		Q.4 Instance Variables −:
	       	Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.an instance variable is
	       	a variable defined in a class (also called  member variable), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance 
		variable has similarities with a class variable, but is non-static. An instance variable is a variable which is declared in a class but outside of constructors,
	       	methods, or blocks. Instance variables are created when an object is instantiated, and are accessible to all the constructors, methods, or blocks in the class.
	       	Access modifiers can be given to the instance variable.An instance variable is not a class variable although there are similarities. It is a type of class
	       	attribute (or class property, field, or data member). The same dichotomy between instance and class members applies to methods ("member functions") as well;
	       	a class may have both instance methods and class methods.

		Each instance variable lives in memory for the life of the object it is owned by.Variables are properties an object knows about itself. All instances of an 
		object have their own copies of instance variables, even if the value is the same from one object to another. One object instance can change values of its
	       	instance variables without affecting all other instances. Instance variables can be used by all methods of a class unless the method is declared as static.
