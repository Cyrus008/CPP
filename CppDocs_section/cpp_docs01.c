Data type:
=========
	In programming language the "Data Type" or simply "type" is an attribute of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to
       	use the data. Most programming languages support basic data types :
		1.integer numbers (of varying sizes), 
		2.floating-point numbers (which approximate real numbers)
       		3.characters and Booleans.

	All variables use data-type during declaration to restrict the type of data to be stored. Therefore, we can say that data types are used to tell the 
	variables which type of data it can store. Whenever a variable is defined in C++, the compiler allocates some memory for that variable based on the
       	data-type with which it is declared.Data types in C++ is mainly divided into three types: 

	A.Primitive Data Types:
       	These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables. example: int, char , float, bool etc.
       	Primitive data types available in C++ are: 
		A.1 Integer
		A.2 Character
		A.3 Boolean
		A.4 Floating Point
		A.5 Double Floating Point
		A.6 Valueless or Void
		A.7 Wide Character
	
	B.Derived Data Types: 
	The data-types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely: 
		B.1 Function
		B.2 Array
		B.3 Pointer
		B.4 Reference
	C.Abstract or User-Defined Data Types: 
	These data types are defined by user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes: 
		C.1 Class
		C.2 Structure
		C.3 Union
		C.4 Enumeration
		C.4 Typedef defined DataType
